 id="x1-1000"></a>REDHAWK Release Notes, Version 2.1.0</h2>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >The effort in REDHAWK 2.1.0 focused on:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Adding support for Components to be deployed on a specific GPP, and conversely
      allowing the GPP to restrict deployments through a matching set of id/value pairs.
      These id/value pairs are defined in the Software Assembly Descriptor and Device
      Configuration  Definition  files  respectively.  Users  may  refer  to  this  feature  as  the
      "special snowflake" deployment Property.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Shared address space Components: Significant enhancement of Component model
      and BulkIO to support high performance I/O. Preliminary developer documentation
      for the REDHAWK 2.1.0 beta release is available at <a 
href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address</span></a>.
      This feature will be under extensive evaluation during the 2.1.x beta release series
      and is expected to provide the ground work for several new major enhancements to
      REDHAWK.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Adding  support  for  a  new  type  of  Property,  "utctime",  extending  the  list  that
      includes  types  such  as  "short"  or  "string".  This  timestamp  Property  is  used  in
      Property change events and can be queried from Components/Devices with the id
      QUERY_TIMESTAMP, which is useful when synchronizing the state of the system.
      The  new  type  of  Property  can  be  used  by  Component/Device  developers  as  an
      additional type of Property.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Adding   cacheDirectory   and   workingDirectory   Properties   to   the   GPP.   These
      properties   provide   the   deployer   with   control   over   where   Components   are
      stored  (cacheDirectory)  and  the  directory  from  which  Components  are  executed
      (workingDirectory).
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Redesigning the IDE&#8217;s Event Viewer to improve the ability to monitor event channels.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Ending support of Command-line interactive mode (-i) on Components, Services,
      and Devices. Terminal prompt interactions should be through the Python Sandbox.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Improving  Python  tooling  to  help  manage  REDHAWK  systems.  For  example,
      these   improvements   include   eventChannelManager,   allocationManager,   and
      connectionManager helpers as well as simpler event monitoring.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Adding functionality to allow Components that have a usesdevice dependency to
      now  be  launched  on  the  same  host  (i.e.,  Device  Manager/Node)  as  the  Device
      satisfying  the  usesdevice  requirement.  This  functionality  is  provided  through  an
      extension of the componentplacement hostcollocation.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Improving recovery of a REDHAWK Domain after a catastrophic failure. The Device
      Manager reboots all associated Devices/Services when it detects a reset Domain
      Manager  after  a  catastrophic  failure  in  the  Domain  Manager.  This  reboot  only
      happens if (1) persistence is enabled and (2) the name service log, event service
      log, and persistence database are emptied.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Adding   new   concurrent   logging   appender   for   C++   Components   to   improve
      readability of logging messages when multiple processes are writing to the same
      log file.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Improving  the  New  Project  Wizard  to  warn  users  if  the  project  location  selected
      already contains files that will become part of the project. Increase user awareness
      of files that may be moved, deleted, or packaged with a project.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Updating the IDE to use the latest available Eclipse tooling, Eclipse Neon. For more
      information               about               Eclipse               Neon,               refer               to
      <a 
href="http://www.eclipse.org/neon/noteworthy" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">http://www.eclipse.org/neon/noteworthy</span></a>.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Documenting a publisher/subscriber pattern when accessing an EventChannel from
      the Domain.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Documenting  available  affinity  processing  directives  when  deploying  Devices,
      Services, and Components.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Adding  support  for  the  REDHAWK  Core  Framework,  IDE,  assets,  and  new
      REDHAWK projects to now compile against and run on Java 8.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Extending DeviceManager to call configure() on Services at the time they register.
      This enables users to implement custom Property handling if so desired.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Resolving  issue  when  activating  local  servants  for  MessageConsumerPort  and
      MessageSupplierPort Java classes.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Improving  Python  Sandbox  tooling  for  new  Domain  features  and  resources.
      Specifically, extended DataSource to provide access to all the available SRI and the
      data timestamp.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Adding  reservation  schema  graph  in  the  documentation  to  enhance  the  text
      describing capacity allocation reservation for the GPP.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Improving documentation of Signal Related Information (SRI).
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Updating Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
      </li></ul>
<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a

      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Improved DeviceManager to call initalizeProperties or configure for Services that
      implement the CF::PropertyEmitter or CF::PropertySet interface.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added a rolling file appender that synchronizes access to a central file from multiple

      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added IDE support to generate new C++ components as shared address space
      components.

      <li class="itemize">Added the ability to launch shared address space Components in the Sandbox.
      </li>

      Component.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added editor support to filter Components that can be launched on a Device.

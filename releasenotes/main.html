the Component to use the new 2.0 Code Generator. If you select <span

project files are modified to indicate the new 2.0 Code Generator has been used.
Once these project files are modified, it is difficult to revert back to use the 1.8-style
Code Generators for this Component. If you select <span

Component is not modified. Upgrading to the new 2.0 Code Generator offers the following
benefits:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">New  Component  pattern  shifts  BulkIO  and  BurstIO  implementation  from  code
      generator to base classes to ease incorporating future BulkIO-related bug fixes and
      enhancements.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">New code generators support use of complex Properties.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">New code generators are now easily accessed from command line.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">New  Java  Component  pattern  mirrors  the  existing  Python  and  C++  Component
      model with a generated base class and a <span 
class="ectt-1200">serviceFunction </span>in the main class.
      </li>

 id="x1-25000"></a>IDE Improvements</h4>
<!--l. 280--><p class="noindent" >The following IDE improvements were completed in REDHAWK 2.0.
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">When selecting IDLs (when dealing with Ports or with Services), the IDE now filters
      uncommon or potentially problematic IDLs unless the user selects to show all.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The XML editor (instead of a text editor) is now used when opening REDHAWK XML
      files from the Target SDR or from a domain.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Warning messages for the IDE detecting that the <span 
class="ectt-1200">localfile/codefile </span>(for an SPD
      implementation) were missing on disk have been improved.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The   IDE   can   handle   receiving   a   null   reference   to   a   Component   from   the
      Waveform.  This  supports  inspecting  some  domains,  which  were  not  exhibiting
      REDHAWK-compliant behavior.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The IDE uses WebKit on CentOS 6.6+ to improve the display of pop-up context help.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Tooltips  to  display  Property  descriptions  were  added  to  the  FrontEnd  Tuner
      Allocation dialog.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">If  an  error  occurs  while  the  IDE  is  determining  what  files  to  generate  during
      code generation, the IDE will display the command it tried to execute to facilitate
      diagnosing problems/error reporting.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Ports have been moved to a separate tab in the SPD editor, and that tab is included
      in the SCD editor.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">After  performing  code  generation,  the  IDE  places  the  code  generator  version  in
      the SPD file in the <span 
class="ectt-1200">type </span>attribute of <span 
class="ectt-1200">softpkg</span>. This helps identify what version of
      REDHAWK a particular asset was originally created for.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  IDE  can  handle  an  <span 
class="ectt-1200">UnknownPort </span>exception  when  it  requests  a  Port  from  a
      Component that is listed in its SCD file. This supports inspecting some Components,
      which were not exhibiting REDHAWK-compliant behavior.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  IDE  now  installs  and  builds  C++  Components,  Devices,  and  Services  by
      invoking <span 
class="ectt-1200">build.sh </span>at the top level of the project. This applies to new projects and
      projects that have their <span 
class="ectt-1200">build.sh </span>regenerated with code generation.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The IDE performs a clean build after code generation to help prevent stale build
      artifacts.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The IDE supports setting Group ID in the Tuner Allocation dialog.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added  an  advanced  option  to  uninstall  the  existing  Waveform  factory  when
      launching a Waveform.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Advanced  launch  options  are  available  when  launching  Components,  Devices,
      Services,  Waveforms,  and  Nodes  in  the  Sandbox,  including  setting  Properties,
      auto-start, timeouts, and log level.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The IDE honors the BulkIO SRI <span 
class="ectt-1200">blocking </span>flag by default when plotting. This setting
      can be overridden in the plot settings.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When  plotting,  individual  streams  can  be  hidden.  Additionally,  the  color  of  the
      streams can be changed.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When  the  IDE  creates  connections  to  plot  or  monitor  data,  it  now  prefixes  its
      connections with <span 
class="ectt-1200">IDE_ </span>so they can be better identified.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The IDE provides the ability to toggle between showing RF and IF values on plot
      axes.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  IDE  supports  connecting  to  multiple  domains  with  the  same  name,  but  on
      different machines (previously, the names had to be unique).
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The IDE now thins plot data based on refresh rate. This helps when plotting Ports
      with very high/very low data rates. The setting is adjustable in the plot settings.</li></ul>

      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Exporting multiple projects to the Target SDR via the context menu on projects only
      exported the first project in the selection.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Before performing code generation, the IDE may have shown several warnings in
      the SPD editor that code generation had not yet been performed. These warnings
      sometimes remained even after performing code generation.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Sequence Properties of <span 
class="ectt-1200">complex </span>type were not treated correctly resulting in issues
      displaying or setting the Properties at runtime.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When a domain was launched via the IDE, the console always showed the domain
      name as <span 
class="ectt-1200">REDHAWK_DEV </span>regardless of its actual name.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Domain Waveforms opened with the Chalkboard editor might get started/stopped
      twice when the Waveform was started/stopped.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">REDHAWK C++ Service projects might have warnings/errors related to not being
      able to find included code. These are cleared up by new settings applied by code
      generation and by completing a build.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">On  Ubuntu,  after  building  the  first  time,  the  IDE  would  report  errors  such  as
      <span 
class="ectt-1200">installing ./config.sub</span>,  <span 
class="ectt-1200">installing ./install.sh</span>,  etc.  This  is  corrected  for
      legacy projects during code generation.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The install location of a Waveform or Node was being determined by the project
      name when it should have been based on the name in the XML.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">For  existing  REDHAWK  projects,  some  settings  were  not  updated  during  code
      generation.  These  included  environment  variables  (like  <span

      parsers.

      <li class="itemize">The IDE would automatically overwrite the <span

      <li class="itemize">The IDE would automatically overwrite the <span

      <li class="itemize">The IDE now correctly parses forward-declarations in IDL files.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  SPD  editor  did  not  allow  saving  changes  in  the  code  section  for  a  selected
      implementation.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  IDE  was  adding  spaces  into  complex  number  expressions  in  Properties  in
      XML  (for  example,  <span 
class="ectt-1200">1 + j3 </span>rather  than  <span

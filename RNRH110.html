<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>IDE Changes</h4>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The ability to connect to BulkIO CORBA connections using native omniORB libraries
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      has been added. This provides a significant increase in the bandwidth of the BulkIO
      connections and aids in the plotting of high speed data.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">A  Connect  Wizard  was  added  to  simplify  the  process  of  creating  connections
      manually.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">A one-step control panel generation button was added to simplify the process of
      generating Control Panels.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">A text filter box that accepts regular expressions was added to the Diagram Palettte
      to simplify the process of finding Components.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  ability  to  launch  additional  Components  into  running  Waveforms  was  added
      to  simplify  testing  Waveforms.  This  feature  is  available  for  Waveforms  within  the
      Sandbox AND on a Domain.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">REDHAWK  Event  Channels  were  added  as  elements  displayed  within  the  SCA
      Explorer.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The Event Viewer received the following improvements:
           <ul class="itemize2">
           <li class="itemize">The controls at the top of the Event Viewer were modified.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Channels are now added via the context menu from the SCA Explorer or the
           CORBA Name browser view.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">The name of the View now matches the name of the Event Channel to which
           the View is connected.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Events are now sorted by time in reverse order (by default).
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Clear and Scroll Lock buttons were added.</li></ul>
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Options to deploy projects to the Target SDR via Hot Keys or a context menu were added
      for flexibility.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The ability to add arbitrary arguments to the nodeBooter process for launching Domain
      and Device Managers has been added.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The Name Browser View was updated by adding icons for REDHAWK-related
      Components that match those found in the SCA Explorer.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">An Octave Wizard and code generator was added to simplify converting existing M-files
      into REDHAWK C++ Components. The user imports an existing M-file, as well as any
      required dependent M-files, and then maps the M-file&#8217;s inputs and outputs to REDHAWK
      Ports and Properties.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The ability to plot dataSDDS Ports was added.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The IDE now displays non-PRF Runtime Properties as read-only.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The Snapshot Tool now provides the ability to create a Custom Connection ID to use when
      acquiring samples.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The SRI View was created to enable the IDE to connect to an output Port and get the push
      SRI call and display this information.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Many improvements were made in how REDHAWK handles FrontEnd Interface
      Devices.
           <ul class="itemize2">
           <li class="itemize">An  Allocation  wizard  was  added  to  enable  users  to  allocate  a  tuner  on  a
           FrontEnd Interface Device.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">A FrontEnd Device Project wizard and code generator template was added to
           enable users to quickly create FrontEnd compliant RX or TX tuner Devices.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">The REDHAWK IDE can now be used to plot data being passed through a
           FrontEnd Interface tuner.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">The REDHAWK IDE can now be used to interact with FrontEnd Devices using
           the SCA Explorer View. These interactions include exploring the Devices and
           allocating and deallocating tuners and listeners.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">The REDHAWK IDE can now be used to interact with FrontEnd Devices via a
           Domain connection.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">The REDHAWK IDE can now be used to interact with FrontEnd Devices using
           the Eclipse Property view.</li></ul>
      </li></ul>
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>C++ Components/Devices Changes</h4>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Logging   has   been   upgraded.   It   is   now   possible   to   perform   logging   on   a
      per-Component basis rather than for the whole class. Also, new appenders have
      been added that allow logging to be accessed through the network or the event
      service.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Allocation callbacks have been added to C++ Devices. Instead of overloading the
      <span 
class="ectt-1200">allocateCapacity </span>call, individual callbacks can be created and registered against
      any allocation Property on a Device.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">FrontEnd Interface support has been extended for C++. A wizard in the IDE guides
      a developer through the decisions necessary to establish the XML for a FrontEnd
      Interfaces-compatible Device. Based on this XML, the code generators generate a
      Device that contains specialized callbacks that reduce the implementation burden
      on the developer.</li></ul>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Python Changes</h4>
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >Property change callbacks can now be created and registered in the same way as C++ and
Java.
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Interface Changes</h4>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">A  new  interface,  Burst  I/O,  has  been  created.  This  interface  supports  the  rapid
      delivery of bursty data, or data whose SRI changes frequently. Use and support for
      Burst I/O follows similar patterns to Bulk I/O. Support is available in C++, Python,
      and Java.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Bulk  I/O  Port  implementations  now  support  multi-out  capabilities.  When  the
      Component or Device contains the <span 
class="ectt-1200">ConnectionTable </span>property, all Bulk I/O or Burst
      I/O  Ports  on  the  Component  or  Device  support  the  pairing  of  stream  ID  and
      connection ID.</li></ul>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Tooling Changes</h4>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The Sandbox now contains a <span 
class="ectt-1200">SoundSink</span>. The <span 
class="ectt-1200">SoundSink </span>creates audio based on
      input coming through a Bulk I/O Port. The Sandbox also supports artificial event
      channels, allowing Components that have event channel interfaces to connect to an
      event channel outside the context of the event service.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ectt-1200">qtbrowse</span>, a tool to inspect running domains, has been updated to work with Qt4. A
      new qt tool, <span 
class="ectt-1200">rhlauncher</span>, has been created. This tool is a graphical convenience tool
      for running domains.</li></ul>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Core Framework Changes</h4>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The Domain Manager can now be connected to other Domain Managers. When
      this connection exists, if a <span 
class="ectt-1200">usesdevice </span>relationship cannot be satisfied by the local
      Domain, it will delegate the allocation to any other registered Domain.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The search algorithm used by the Application Factory for Devices suitable for an
      Application&#8217;s Components has been substantially accelerated.</li></ul>

project files are modified to indicate the new 1.10 Code Generator has been used.
Once these project files are modified, it is difficult to revert back to use the 1.8-style
Code Generators for this Component. If you select <span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">Cancel</span>, the source code for the
Component is not modified. Upgrading to the new 1.10 Code Generator offers the following
benefits:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">New  component  pattern  shifts  BulkIO  and  BurstIO  implementation  from  code

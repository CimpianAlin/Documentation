      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Python BulkIO Ports now report error messages during pushPacket and pushSRI
      operations.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      </li>

      <li class="itemize">When  specifying  a  user  when  daemonizing  nodeBooter,  all  the  user&#8217;s  groups
      (primary and secondary) are associated with the process. Also, groups can now be
      defined as comma-separated names on the group switch when starting nodeBooter.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">On startup, calls to the configure function on the Component or Device only occur if
      there is at least one Property to update.

      cases.

      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When  DeviceManager  is  launched  and  DomainManager  is  not  available  and

      <li class="itemize">FileSink sets the subsize field in BLUE file headers to match the frame size when
      the input stream is two-dimensional.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">FileSink formats framed data correctly with BLUE file output.
      </li>

      form of type 2000 files.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The Sandbox&#8217;s DataSink can handle framed data of type &#8217;char&#8217;.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The bluefile module properly chunks framed two-dimensional (framed/type 2000)
      data. It also properly handles complex data when it is two-dimensional.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">FileSink  now  uses  the  timestamp  of  the  first  BulkIO  packet  to  set  the  header
      timecode for BLUE file output.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">At the end of BLUE files, FileSource would sometimes send a zero-length packet
      with no EOS and a zero-length packet with EOS set. The zero-length packet with no
      EOS was removed.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Eclipse plotting widgets can be started from the Python Sandbox.

      fully-qualified namespaced name.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">If a Component was shutdown while pushing data, it would occasionally deadlock.
      This race condition was removed.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When pushing data, the Sandbox DataSource advances the time stamp according
      to the initial time and the number of samples sent.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">If an FEI Device contains input BulkIO Ports, releasing a tuner does not cause an
      error message.

      handled properly.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Deallocation  of  an  FEI  controlling  allocation  ID  cannot  be  done  using  a  listener
      allocation structure.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The SRI changed status is provided for the first packet received using the stream
      API.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">An application&#8217;s getPortSet() method uses the external Port name provided in its
      SAD file.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Empty  directories  are  not  created  in  the  GPP&#8217;s  cache  directory  when  log4py
      FileAppender is configured with the absolute file path.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When a BulkIO input stream receives an EOS, the input Port&#8217;s getCurrentStream()
      now always returns the stream once to give the caller a chance to check for EOS.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Fixed possible Python FEI Device deadlock issue when responding to requests (for
      example, getTunerEnable, allocateCapacity).</li></ul>

<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >The following previously reported Known Issues have been closed in REDHAWK 2.0.5 with the
following resolutions:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Won&#8217;t Fix
           <ul class="itemize2">
           <li class="itemize">GPP Component output log feature is fragile - This issue is OBE. It relates
           to the Python version of the 1.8 GPP, which is no longer supported as of the
           release of the REDHAWK 2.0 GPP, which is written in C++.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Non_existent yielding false negatives - This issue is limited to tests, and no
           tests have failed because of a false positive, so this should be addressed only
           if tests are not passing.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Populate_deviceAddedEvent and _serviceAddedEvent functions in the Domain
           class of the REDHAWK core package - This issue is OBE with the release of
           REDHAWK 2.0 as Device and Service members are generated from registered
           DeviceManagers that manage the life cycle of Devices and Services.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">sb.loadSADFile  does  not  allow  multiple  instances  -  Not  allowing  multiple
           instances of a Waveform is by design. The issue has been converted to a New
           Feature requirement and its resolution is deferred to a future release.</li></ul>

      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Newly created projects are properly configured so that projects now report warnings
      and errors in the Problems view for Redhawk XML files.

      <li class="itemize">The logging menu is not shown for Waveforms.

      XML referenced a non-existent Component instantiation.

      launched in the Sandbox.

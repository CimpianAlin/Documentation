 id="x3-20001"></a>Introduction</h2>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Sub$100 is an example REDHAWK implementation project that demonstrates the powerful
capabilities of REDHAWK on a constrained budget. The goal of this project is to show that
REDHAWK can execute beneficial, real-time processing applications on a platform with limited
resources. This project uses REDHAWK on a BeagleBone Black to receive an FM radio
signal using an RTL Device; however, you could also use this hardware to process other
types of RF signals, such as ADS-B data, GPS data, or images from the NOAA weather
satellites. The REDHAWK application then recovers the RBDS data (Artist, song,
station, etc.) and outputs this data to the user. The total equipment cost is less than
$100.
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x3-30001.1"></a>What is REDHAWK?</h3>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >REDHAWK is a software defined radio (SDR) framework designed to support the development,
deployment, and management of real-time software radio applications. To support the design and
development of software applications, REDHAWK provides tools that allow development and
testing of software modules (DSP processing blocks) called "Components" and composition of
Components into "Waveform Applications" that can be seamlessly deployed on a single computer
or multiple network-enabled computers. The Component-based nature of REDHAWK allows
easy code reuse within a Waveform as well as between different Waveforms. Using the
REDHAWK IDE, developers can create new Components and arrange them into Waveforms,
making connections between Components in a very visual way by using the input and
output ports of the Components. REDHAWK uses a middle ware technology to provide
seamless data exchange between different processor architectures and different software
languages. For more information about REDHAWK, refer to the REDHAWK User
Manual.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x3-40001.2"></a>What is an RTL Device?</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >RTL Devices are Digital Video Broadcast-Terrestrial (DVB-T) USB devices originally
intended to allow computer reception of television in Europe. However, the Devices have
been reverse-engineered by the SDR community to act as a cheap stand-in for more
expensive Devices such as the USRP and Matchstiq, albeit only with reception capabilities.
Because the tuner allows configuration of parameters, such as the center frequency to tune
to, the sample rate at which to sample the analog signal, and the gain to amplify or
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
attenuate the signal by, these devices serve as an adequate FrontEnd Device for an SDR
project. The frequency range of the Devices range from 20 MHz up to around 2 GHz,
allowing users to receive data such as FM Radio, GPS, Air Traffic data, and many
others.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x3-50001.3"></a>What is the BeagleBone Black?</h3>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >The BeagleBone Black is an embedded development board similar to the Raspberry
Pi. With an ARM processor, internet connectivity, and USB hosting capabilities, it
can serve as a PC if need be, although a simple one. Because the BeagleBone Black is
capable of running Linux, it is also capable of running the REDHAWK framework.
Because of REDHAWK&#8217;s many dependencies, it is desirable to use a distribution of Linux
with an existing build for the BeagleBone Black as well as with a package management
system capable of providing these dependencies. Ubuntu was chosen because a pre-built
BeagleBone Black image now exists and due to the robustness of its package manager,
aptitude.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.4   </span> <a 
 id="x3-60001.4"></a>What is the Radio Broadcast Data System (RBDS)?</h3>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >The Radio Broadcast Data System (RBDS) is the U.S. version of the Radio Data System (RDS)
European standard. These standards are intended to provide supplemental information to FM
broadcast radio listeners such as meta information about the audio or traffic data. The spectrum of
a typical FM broadcast after tuning to baseband is shown below:
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" ><img

><br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >The Mono data is seen from about 0 Hz up to 15 kHz, and the pilot tone sits at 19kHz. The left
and right audio channels are between 23 kHz and 53 kHz. Finally, the RBDS information is
centered at 57 kHz.

 id="x3-70001.5"></a>How REDHAWK Works with a BeagleBone Black and an RTL Device to Make an RBDS
Receiver</h3>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >In this SUB$100 project, the BeagleBone Black coordinates the interaction between the FrontEnd
Device and the Components executing on the processor, as well as the execution of the
REDHAWK Domain Manager. The RTL collects the data, and REDHAWK runs on the
BeagleBone Black and processes the data. This manual explains the steps required to complete the
Sub$100 project.
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >After completing the tasks in this manual, a REDHAWK Domain Manager, Device Manager and
an RBDS Waveform will be running on the BeagleBone Black. The REDHAWK framework
distributes the RBDS Components executables (built for the armv7l processor) to one or more
BeagleBone Black Nodes. The RBDS Waveform uses an RTL-SDR dongle to tune to an FM radio
station, receives and decodes the RBDS data (Station, Artist, Song Name, etc.), and sends that
information as a Message over an Event Channel. For more information on Events and Messages,
refer to chapters 16 and 17 in the REDHAWK User Manual. The development computer will have
the ability to passively listen for received messages and will be able to examine and plot
output data of the RBDS Waveform Components using the stand-alone REDHAWK
IDE.
